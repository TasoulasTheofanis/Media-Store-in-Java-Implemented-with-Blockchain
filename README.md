# Media-Store-in-Java Implemented with Blockchain
#### This is a simple program in Java for renting movies, books, videos, music. It implements a blockchain logic to log all the transactions done. 

#### You can create a user who will have his own Digital wallet (private key and public key) and will be able to rent a media for 1 dollar. Each session (starting and closing the application) will create a block. A block will contain all transactions made (rental or return). The admin user is the one who gets paid and he will be able to see the users and the blockchain that has been created. The program briefly consists of:

Media class: title, type (book, movie, etc), length, genre, description, artists, averageRating, ratingsCount
Block class: contains properties such as id, nonce, timeStamp, hash, previousHash list of transactions.
CryptographyHelper class: provides methods for hashing data, generating key pairs using ECDSA, and applying/verifying digital signatures using ECDSA.
Transaction class: each transaction consists of Id, sender (the user who rents, returns), the receiver (always the admin), signature, action (rent, return), title of media.
Wallet class: privateKey and publicKey, which are generated by java package.
User class: name, email, password, balance.

#### The blockchain will be the set of blocks, with the further purpose of ensuring the integrity of transactions and ensuring their undesired modification. User data (except the wallet), blocks and transactions will be stored in json files. User passwords will be hashed on the JSON file.

#### After importing the project to your IDE (Eclipse, Visual Code, etc.), you may need to configure the build path.

#### After that, run the app.java application and login (All passwords are 1234 for the users. Admin's password is 12345. You can see Users on the JSON file.)

#### As admin you can view the blockchain and the users' data by pressing 7.

#### In order to rent a media you need balance (in USD) greater or equal to 1. Otherwise, add balance. You may also return Medias.
